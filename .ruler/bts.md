- Used by the CLI to understand your project structure
- Safe to delete if not needed
- Updated automatically when using the `add` command

## Key Points

- This is a Turborepo monorepo using bun workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `bun run command-name`
- Turborepo handles build caching and parallel execution
- Use `bunx
create-better-t-stack add` to add more features later
