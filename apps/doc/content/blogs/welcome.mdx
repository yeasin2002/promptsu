# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the blog functionality. Unlike the documentation pages, blog posts don't have a sidebar and focus on the content.

## Features

- Clean, distraction-free reading experience
- Full MDX support for rich content
- Responsive design
- Fast static generation

## Getting Started

You can create new blog posts by adding MDX files to the `content/blogs` directory. Each post should have frontmatter with at least a title and description.
