title: Prompt Enhancer Extension Setup
description: This browser extension adds a prompt enhancer button to ChatGPT's interface. When clicked, it currently doubles the text in the input field (as a placeholder functionality that you can modify later).
---

## Installation Instructions

### Chrome/Edge

1. Build the extension: `pnpm run build`
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `dist/chrome-mv3` folder
6. The extension should now be loaded

### Firefox

1. Build for Firefox: `pnpm run build:firefox`
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox"
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from `dist/firefox-mv2` folder

## Testing

1. Go to https://chatgpt.com
2. Type some text in the input field (e.g., "Write a story about")
3. Look for the new enhancer button (with a plus icon and small circle) next to the voice/speech buttons
4. Click the enhancer button
5. The text should be doubled in the input field (e.g., "Write a story about Write a story about")
6. You can then submit the enhanced prompt or modify it further

## Current Functionality

- **Target**: ChatGPT interface (chatgpt.com and chat.openai.com)
- **Action**: Doubles the current text in the prompt input
- **Location**: Injected next to the existing voice/speech buttons

## Code Structure

- `src/entrypoints/content.ts`: Main content script that injects the button and handles the enhancement logic
- `src/assets/content-styles.css`: Styles to match ChatGPT's existing button design
- The button uses a custom SVG icon that matches the existing interface style

## Customization

To modify the enhancement logic, edit the `enhancePrompt()` function in `src/entrypoints/content.ts`. Currently it does:

```javascript
const enhancedText = currentText + " " + currentText;
```

You can replace this with any prompt enhancement logic you want to implement later.
